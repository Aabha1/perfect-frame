# The Perfect Frame Project Part Two

## About

Part 1 of the project has some sample pictures. On submitting an image to it, the link is directed to Part 2. The search bar has some keywords already written; you need to click on "my type". Then The algorithm will show you the required result. You can click on the product to open its details and add it to your cart. The website is not responsive on smaller screens and can be supported on all the desktops and larger screens. In the sign-in screen, the frontend is implemented. But there is some problem in the backend, so functions have been disabled. The brand name used is an anchor tag that connects the 1st part of the project to it. Currently, I am trying to learn MongoDB to make this project better and add more features to it.

## Details

This project is an average e-commerce website with Home Screen, Product Screen and Cart Screen fully implemented and functional. Sign in, and the register screen still has some work left. The search bar is made but works by submitting it two times currently. The product images have been selected randomly from google. You can find all data in data.js, which I have created with some products. Only node_modules is being imported. I made all HTML, CSS and javascript files.
